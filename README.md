# RTL-SDR Radio

> As of writing this (July 16th, 2024), this is just a simple GUI wrapper for the `nrsc5` CLI. However, I envision this project to evolve and bundle all the tools into a nice user interface to make the most out of your RTL-SDR.

RTL-SDR Radio is your one-stop shop for listening to the radio frequencies in the air. Using this app, you can listen to any [HD Radio Station](https://hdradio.com/stations/) in your area!

## Installation

Installation should be as simple as going to the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/njfdev/rtlsdr-radio/releases) and downloading the most recent application from the "Assets" dropdown for your specific OS (Windows support is expected soon).
